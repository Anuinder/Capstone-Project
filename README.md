Raising Cybersecurity Resilience With CyberSmart Trivia

Capstone Project (2023) on building a gamified Educational Platform for cybersecurity awareness 

### Game: 
CyberSmart Trivia Game


#### Purpose 
These games take inspiration from a well-known show , “Who wants to be a Millionaire” , and adapts this to teach the essential cybersecurity concepts in a fun and interactive way.  For better user engagement and adaptability in classroom settings, it focuses on practical aspects of concepts by achieving milestones at every point to eventually build the skill set in a step by step approach, and providing hints, survival lines and explanations for answers. 
It takes WCAG 2.0 level AA guidelines as reference for ensuring better accessibility.  We have performed  From the OWASP-compatible Commix pen testing and from that it can be said that it is relatively secure considering the targeted HTTP header parameters.  The game offers a wide scope of future enhancements, with one of them connecting with University voice-over IP (VoIP) for implementation of Phone-a-friend life-line. Currently,  It is published on  both UVic server’s and Microsoft Azure. 

The file UI_CyberSmart_Trivia.pdf contains various screenshots of the game.
